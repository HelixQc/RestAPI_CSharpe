## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: 🗂️ Create the Folder Structure** (if not done already)

1. 🏗️ Create a folder named `<Your folder name>`.  
2. 📁 Inside the `<Your folder name>` folder, create another folder named `<Your folder name>-db`.  
3. 🔄 Clone the repository **kshtech_API** into the `<Your folder name>` folder using the command:

    ```sh
    https://github.com/HelixQc/AuthentificationServices.git
    ```

### **Step 2: 🐘 Set Up the Database**

1. 🛳️ Use the following Docker command to create a PostgreSQL database container:

    ```sh
    docker run --name <Your Container Name> -e POSTGRES_USER=<Your Postgres Username> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<Your Password> -e POSTGRES_DB=<Your Database Name> -p <Port Number>:5432 -v <Your File Path>:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres  
    ```  

   📝 **Explanation of the command:**  
   - 🔹 `<Your Container Name>`: Replace with your preferred name for the Docker container.  
   - 🔹 `<Your Postgres Username>`: Specify your PostgreSQL username.  
   - 🔹 `<Your Password>`: Set your PostgreSQL password.  
   - 🔹 `<Your Database Name>`: Name the database as desired.  
   - 🔹 `<Port Number>`: Choose the port you want to use (e.g., `5432`).  
   - 🔹 `<Your File Path>`: Provide the path to the `kshtech-db` folder you created earlier.  

   💡 **Note:** This command initializes a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker container.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verify that you're using the absolute path to your folder.

### **Step 3: 🛠️ Create the `appsettings.json` File**

1. Create a `appsettings.json` file
2. Follow the template:

    },
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
      }
    }
  ```
3. Fill out the file with project-specific information as provided by the project manager.

### **Step 4: 📊 Update the Database**

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., **Visual Studio** or **Rider**).  
2. In the **Package Manager Console**, run the following command:

    ```
    update-database
    ```  

   💡 **Note:** This command initializes the database with Identity Framework tables and other schema updates.
